# Web to App
This android app can convert any website to an android app. <br>
Just set the value of the string variable "url" to your desired website url in MainActivity.java. <br>

# Development Environment: <br>
Android Studio 4.0 <br>

# Minimum System Requirement: <br>
Android 4.1 <br>

# Acknowledgement
Android Webview is not appropriate for handling popups. So, I took help from this <a href="https://github.com/hwasiti/Android-popup-webview-handler">repository</a> & modify something to handle popups.
